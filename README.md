# 🤖 Isaac Sim – Getting Started with Robot Simulation

This repository documents my learning project based on NVIDIA’s **"Getting Started: Simulating Your First Robot in Isaac Sim"** course. It covers the complete pipeline for building, simulating, and controlling a robot in the Isaac Sim environment using ROS 2.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 1. Robot Construction
- Assembled a mobile robot with chassis, wheels, and joints.
- Defined visual and collision meshes for realistic appearance and interaction.

### 🌐 2. Physics Configuration
- Configured ground plane, gravity, and collision properties.
- Used articulation joints and physics materials to simulate dynamics.

### 🧠 3. Control System
- Implemented differential drive using **OmniGraph** and **ROS 2**.
- Integrated Articulation Controllers for managing wheel movement.

### 👁️ 4. Sensor Integration
- Mounted and configured RGB camera and 2D LiDAR.
